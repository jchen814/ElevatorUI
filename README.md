Touch Pad Demo Walkthrough
1. "Swipe" to proceed to the keypad.
2. HIt 4 on the keypad, then hit enter.
3. While in transition you may still swipe to go to the keypad, or wait until floor is reached to swipe.
4. At this keypad hit 2 to go to the second floor.
5. Swipe once again to bring up the keypad.
6. This time, hit 1, then 0, but instead of hitting enter hit clear.
7. After this hit enter and from here you may either swipe to enter the keypad again or "hold" (tap) to enter voice.
8. At the voice screen you may tap again to go back to the main screen, this is to symbolize your voice input and tapping for entry (But   this is solely to show UI design so the function itself does not work.)
9. Similar with the keypad at this point in time it is just to show that this is what you can do with the base UI.
